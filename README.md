# CMP-256-Assignment-1

a) Pick a kaggle data set which might be fairly noisy (Eg: https://analyticsindiamag.com/10-datasets-for-data-cleaning-practice-for-beginners/ (Links to an external site.) or more)

b) write a data cleaning and preprocessing  and visualization colab using any data set - you can find few from kaggle  etc...

c) you can do model training with scikit learn as well but we will not check the accuracy/performance of the model. the main focus is whether you did the right data 
cleaning

Please try to use a number of techniques in there and do comprehensive cleaning and pre processing. write colab with great comments and description 

please submit the colab and a read.me in github folder - provide the url of github folder (with full public access)

Try to combine number of techniques in leaderboard members of kaggle for data cleaning if possible. 

## Have Choosen Hotel-Booking dataset from the below link
 https://analyticsindiamag.com/10-datasets-for-data-cleaning-practice-for-beginners
 
**Dataset:** : _https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand_

**Colab File:** _Hotel_Booking.ipynb_

**STEPS FOLLOWED:**

### 1) DOWNLOADING DATASET, INSTALLING & LOADING MODULES FOR ANALYSIS

### 2) UNDERSTANDING DATA

### 3) DATA WRANGLING FOR EDA

### 4) EDA

### 5) FINDING DATA CORELATION & DATA PREPROCESSING FOR ML MODEL

### 6) ML CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS ( KNN, LOGISTIC REGRESSION, SVM )

### 7) ACCURACY COMPARISON OF ALL ML MODELS

Finally, using Google OpenRefine Tool for Data Cleaning operations &  data pre-processiong for the same dataset
